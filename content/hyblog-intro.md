Welcome to Hyblog, the official blog from Hyreads. We are on a path towards shared prosperity and this is another good chance to engage with each other. 'As we KNOW better we will DO better' You are spot on. Children mostly acquire their values from their parent and their relatives. The family values stem from the social values that the society of today has passed to be right, & we are the society, each one of us. We have to stand up and own the responsibility of creating the society we desire for ourselves and our future generations. We are supposed to do better than the generation before us, we have to create a better society for our children than the one they left us.
