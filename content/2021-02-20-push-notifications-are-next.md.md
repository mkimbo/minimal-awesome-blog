Have you always wondered whether email subscriptions to your blog are effective in re-engaging your audience each time you post a new article? Well, me too. And that's why I thought of implementing Push Notifications on this blog. Your readers will get instant notifications which contain the title and link of your latest post, even when they are offline. I believe push notifications are more effective in alerting your audience of new posts more than emails as they are brief and straightforward. They also appear right on the subscribing device notification section and this is more convenient than inside the mail box.

Readers can also choose to subscribe to all posts on your blog or certain categories only, and since in this blog every post is categorized, this will be even better for your readers.

Watch out this space for more awesome features. Push notifications feature rolling out soon.
